A Student Grade Calculator is a simple program that takes the marks of a student in multiple subjects, calculates the total marks, average marks, and assigns a grade based on the average. This project helps beginners practice working with arrays, loops, and conditionals in C.

Functionality:
Input: The program takes the marks of a student in multiple subjects (e.g., 5 subjects).
Processing:
It calculates the total marks by summing the marks of all subjects.
It then calculates the average by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.
Output:
The program displays the total marks.
The program displays the average marks.
Based on the average, it assigns a grade using predefined criteria (e.g., A, B, C, D, or F).
Grade Criteria Example:
A: 90% or above
B: 70% to 89%
C: 50% to 69%
D: 40% to 49%
F: Below 40%
